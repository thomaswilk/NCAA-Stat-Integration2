mabye add timeouts if we are going to try and estimate real time.

add something for this "30-second clock violation by MAR." found it on NCAA Play by play, not seen before 




FACE OFF MATCHING 
1. Browse games and find a quarter where cv < pbp (cv misses a face off)
    then figure out an algorithm to properly do that 

2. Figure out mapping of the team names. 
    (Maybe just a mapping util ran at the end)

3. Decide which method to prune faceoffs

4. Figure out how faceoffs with no teams should be handled
    (Some cases they are an indicator of a false detection while others they truly just dont have a name)



STAT MATCHING

one side of this project which I havent given much thought to yet is deciding how to line up the rest of 
the stats up. Once we get all the faceoffs lined up, that will be good, but whats next?

1. Looking at transition
    From past scripts, we infered from the stat "Clear Attempt" which team has possession.
    Using this we can line up clear attempt stats with the fillm_time_end and then all stats go in between 

    So for that case it would be 

    [Face off win, (...intermediate stats...), Clear attempt (should be successful but i guess we could parse fails too) ]
    And all of these stats could have the same fillm_time_end and fillm_time_start for now. This kinda reflects jordan's 
    idea of just have each possession labeled with the given stats, but if we get that far, i have a feeling we can do 
    some transformation of game clock difference between each stat to real time and get it more precise. But thats later on 

2. Looking at possessions
    I guess this kinda goes hand and hand with the last one but still nice to have both. I will have to browse to see which 
    one is more accurately predicted/ more reliable from the cv breakdowns
