Explaination of faceoff fitter when there are false detections:


Given two lists of face offs. CV and PBP.

PBP are given game clock only (Q1 15:00, Q2 3:42, Q3 7:05, etc.) This clock counts down, so 10:00 
    is 5:00 after 15:00 rather than ahead, like in real time. 

CV are given film_time start and end, so therefore given real world time. This will come into effect later.


Example data (PBP are converted to "continous" time, like a clock in soccer, (or futbol :)  ) 

Time of PBP face offs 

[0, 3, 8, 12, ... ]

Time of CV face offs

[2, 8, 17, 25, 26, ...]


Step 1: Compute time since last face off (Statfitter.Utils.get_faceoff_difference)

pbp
[ 0, 3, 5, 4, ... ]

cv
[ 2, 7, 8, , ... ]


Step 2: Use some sort of scaling/estimation to conver pbp to real time
